* About
In this project, we use selenium webdriver to test a simple registration page. The page takes username, password(at least 8 character long), rewrites password(that should match original password), email(a valid one) and finally confirms account by clicking on submit.

The form shows error message if the requirements for registration are not fulfilled. 

We use selenium webdriver and write 5 test cases to test them.

* Installation
#+begin_src bash
npm install
tsc test.ts
node test.js
#+end_src

Once you execute the tests using ~node test.js~, selenium webdriver will open a browser instance and perform the tests.
